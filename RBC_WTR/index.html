            Over the course of my internship at RBC, I became very familiar with not only the structure of LPARs, 
            but also the processes of deleting, adding, and managing batch jobs on mainframe software.
            <br>
            Unfortunately, the project of developing the "shift report" website remained in the backlog until 
            the end of my co-op term. However, the absence of this project is the reason why I was introduced to the 
            storage-as-a-service team, which allowed me to work on several aspects of an automation-related project.
            <br>
            With STaaS, the team quickly learned that I was able to handle even their most complex Jira tickets regarding 
            front-end web development. Hence, the team assigned large tickets to me, such as designing the wireframe 
            for a new web page, and developing it myself. I was also able to significantly increase the test coverage of 
            the team's back-end repositories using Python's testing library, pytest.

            This web page provides an overview of the experience I gained through my 4 month internship at RBC.
            <br>
            During my internship at RBC, I had the opportunity to delve into the intricate world of mainframe 
            technology. This experience underscored the enduring significance of mainframes in today's 
            tech industry. Mainframes continue to play a pivotal role in critical business operations, 
            serving as the backbone of many organizations' data processing and transactional needs.
            <br>
            As my internship progressed, I was introduced to the storage-as-a-service team, a transition 
            that marked a significant turning point in my journey. With their support and guidance, 
            I ventured into cloud development, where I quickly demonstrated my capabilities in 
            full-stack development. This experience has not only broadened my skill set but also 
            illuminated the promising path of cloud development in my career. I am excited to carry this 
            knowledge forward and continue contributing to the evolving landscape of technology.

            , a standout member of the Armada team. Nathan's extensive knowledge and expertise in 
            front-end development were instrumental in my growth and development as a front-end developer. 
            His willingness to share his insights and provide guidance on numerous occasions truly helped 
            me make the most of this internship experience.
            <br>
