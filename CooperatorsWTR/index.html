            The Quality Engineering (QE) team is dedicated to ensuring the reliability and performance of the company's
             insurance applications through rigorous and continuous testing. They utilize a comprehensive suite of tools
              and technologies including Selenium for automated browser testing, Java and Python for scripting and back-end
               testing, Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) and ensuring tests align with business requirements,
                JavaScript for front-end validation, and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery. By integrating these
                 tools into their workflow, the QE team can consistently identify and resolve issues, ensuring that all
                  applications meet high standards of quality and functionality before reaching the end-users.

          <p class="font-secondary paragraph-md text-dark">
            Entering this co-op term, I had several goals that I wanted to achieve with regard to developing
            new skills and strengthening existing ones:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-group text-left font-tertiary">
            <li class="list-group-item">Familiarize myself with the Selenium testing framework.
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Gain a better understanding of the role that software engineering plays in the insurance industry.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Introduce new tools/processes that improve the team's efficiency</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p class="font-secondary paragraph-md text-dark">
            By becoming with familiar with the Selenium testing framework, I gain a thorough understanding of Quality Engineering
            concepts, and the role that testing frameworks play in them. 
            <br><br>
            Through my previous co-op terms at Roche and RBC, I have learned first-hand the impact of software engineering on the pharmaceutical
            and banking industries. By working with the quality engineering team at Co-operators, and networking with other software development teams
            within the company, I can gain a better understanding of how software development has benefitted the insurance industry.
            <br><br>
            An important lesson that I have learned through my prior experience as a co-op student is that part of my job is to bring forth 
            new ideas that can help increase the productivity and efficiency of the team that I work with. Introducing new tools and/or processes that 
            can potentially help the test automation team meet their goals will significantly improve the value I bring to the table as a co-op student.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="section-title">Reflection</h4>
          <p class="font-secondary paragraph-md text-dark">
            I have gone above and beyond in achieving my original goal of familiarizing myself with the Selenium testing framework.
            My work with regression testing and debugging defects has helped me gain a very thorough understanding of how Selenium 
            assists in the requirements of a quality engineering team. In addition, I was also given the task of monitoring the Jenkins 
            automated daily runs that also uses Selenium-integration. By doing so, I have gained a proficiency in Selenium-based application testing 
            both locally and on hosted servers.
            <br><br>
            I have shown great initiative in reaching out to different software development teams to learn more about how software engineering
            impacts the insurance industry. I was given the opportunity to connect with 
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-bursey/">Austin Bursey</a>
            from the Dev-Ops team to inquire about the role that his team plays in Quality Engineering for our insurance applications. He also
            linked me to a LinkedIn learning course that dives deeper into the role that Dev-Ops plays in deployment processes. I will be 
            using that course to continue to better my understanding of Dev-Ops in the second half of my co-op term. 
            <br><br>
            Throughout the first 4 months of this co-op term, I was able to improve the team's productivity and efficiency by suggesting and implementing the following:
            <ul class="list-group text-left font-tertiary">
              <li class="list-group-item">A Excel workbook to JSON file converter Python script to automate the conversion of test data sources.

              For my second work term with Co-operators, my goals were focused around building on the 
              foundation of knowledge that I acquired in the first 4 months of this internship. 
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group text-left font-tertiary">
              <li class="list-group-item">Collaborate with 
               DevOps team to identify and resolve configuration related issues within the Jenkins pipeline.

            <p class="font-secondary paragraph-md text-dark">
               These tasks will greatly benefit my next work experience by enhancing both my technical 
               and interpersonal skills. Collaborating with the DevOps team to resolve Jenkins pipeline 
               issues will deepen my understanding of CI/CD processes and foster teamwork and 
               problem-solving skills in a cross-functional environment. 
               Learning and implementing new methods for analyzing test data in Excel will strengthen 
               my analytical abilities and proficiency in data handling. Additionally, networking with 
               people in management roles will expand my professional network, provide insights into leadership 
               paths, and help me learn from experienced colleagues.

            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 20px;" class="section-title">Reflection</h4>
            <p class="font-secondary paragraph-md text-dark">
               Reflecting on my efforts to achieve these goals, I am pleased with the progress I made in 
               expanding my professional network and enhancing my technical skills. I attended all major 
               in-person work events and took the initiative to introduce myself to several people in 
               management roles. These interactions allowed me to learn more about the career journeys and 
               leadership styles of experienced colleagues. By engaging in meaningful conversations and 
               asking insightful questions, I was able to establish connections that could be valuable for 
               my professional growth. These experiences have provided me with a broader perspective on the 
               different paths to leadership within the company and have helped me build a network of 
               mentors and peers who can offer guidance and support.
               <br><br>
               On the technical side, I effectively collaborated with the DevOps team to address 
               configuration-related issues in the Jenkins pipeline. I set up a group chat with my team 
               and a few representatives from DevOps to ensure continuous communication and real-time 
               updates about any issues that occurred on our application. This proactive approach helped in 
               quickly identifying and resolving problems, thereby improving the stability and efficiency of 
               our pipeline. Additionally, I focused on improving our test data analysis by leveraging Excel 
               charts and formulas to create comprehensive reports. These reports provided valuable 
               insights, such as test case run times by server, test case pass rates by product line, and 
               the number of defects per issue type. By presenting this data in an accessible format, I 
               facilitated better decision-making and helped my team focus on areas that required attention, 
               ultimately contributing to improved product quality and performance.
